# Kong Plugin Html Replacer
## a simple plugin to replace text in html responses

[![][kong-logo]][kong-url]

## Summary

This plugin replaces text in html responses based on the configuration.

We also assume that you can already successfully execute the integration tests on the kong source code (`make test-integration`).  

> Running the Kong integration test suite requires both Postgres and Cassandra to be installed and configured to be accessible from your Kong instance according to kong/specs/kong_tests.conf in the Kong source tree. See the [test suite section](https://github.com/Mashape/kong#tests) of the Kong [README](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/README.md)

If everything is working as it should, you can get started.  

makCredit for most of the code in the plugin goes to  [CÃ©dric Tran-Xuan](http://streamdata.io/blog/developing-an-helloworld-kong-plugin/). The [article](http://streamdata.io/blog/developing-an-helloworld-kong-plugin/) is for an older version of Kong, but it is a good starting point.

## Development

### Setup

Setting up your development environment.

1. Go to [this link](https://github.com/Mashape/kong/blob/master/README.md#development) to setup your Kong development environment.

2. Set the `KONG_PATH` environment variable or update the variable in the [Makefile](./Makefile) to point it to your Kong source dir. (default: /kong)

### Run the plugin test suite

Before you start development on your custom plugin, make sure you can run the full test suite with your current Kong source.

```
$ make test-all
```

You should see something like this.

```
vagrant@precise64:/kong-plugins/kong-plugin-html-replacer$ make test-all

## Using Kong with your plugin

### 1. Build your plugin

```bash
$ make install-dev
```

This command installs your plugin locally to a `./lua_modules` directory. The PATH to modules installed in this folder will then be something like:

```bash
/some/path/to/kong-plugin-html-replacer/lua_modules/share/lua/5.1/?.lua
```

> Under the hood make is just executing `luarocks` to install the rock locally. It needs to be installed in order to expand it to the directory structure that corresponds to the module names (i.e. kong.plugins.hello-world.handler => kong/plugins/hello-world/)
Go [here](https://github.com/keplerproject/luarocks/wiki/Documentation) for more luarocks information.

Armed with this information we can use it to tell Kong that we want to load a custom_plugin and where to look for it.

### 2. Tell Kong to start with your plugin


- <strong>Option 1</strong>

  Start Kong with your plugin(s) defined in the `KONG_CUSTOM_PLUGINS` [environment variable]((https://getkong.org/docs/0.9.x/configuration/#environment-variables).

  ```bash
  $ KONG_CUSTOM_PLUGINS='hello-world' \
    KONG_LUA_PACKAGE_PATH=/path/to/your/plugin/?.lua \
    bin/kong start -vv
  ```

  > NOTE: If you apply your plugin to any apis or consumers then your plugin must be included in any subsequent startup or Kong with fail to start.

- <strong>Option 2</strong>

  Update the `custom_plugins` and `lua_package_path` items in the Kong [configuration file](https://getkong.org/docs/latest/configuration/).

  ```
  custom_plugins = hello-world

  ...

  lua_package_path = /path/to/your/plugin/?.lua
  ```

> You can use any combination of the two methods above. Please refer to the configuration [documentation](kong-docs-config).


Checkout the Kong [5-minute Quickstart](https://getkong.org/docs/latest/getting-started/quickstart/) for details on how you can start using your plugin with APIs.

## Notes

I started with the kong-vagrant project for my development environment.  I installed postgres 9.4, and redis, added some items to the path... I might make a PR against that repo soon.
